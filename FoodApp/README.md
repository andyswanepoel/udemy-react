# ReactMeals App

## Getting Started

To run the app locally:
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the `FoodApp` directory by running `cd FoodApp`
- In the `FoodApp` directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- To run the app in development mode, run `npm start`


## Concepts Covered in the App:

Although not overly complex, the app covers quite a few of the new and more advanced features of React.

The concepts that have been covered are: 
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useReducer`
- `useContext`


## Next Steps

### Authentication
- Add some sort of authentication to have the user log in before being able to order

### Database Connection
- Connect to MongoDB to add new food items, track quantity, etc.
